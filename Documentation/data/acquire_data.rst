Acquiring Data For Tracktable
=============================

Internal to Tracktable
======================
A handful of sample test data files are provided with the Tracktable library provided that
Tracktable has been installed from source. These test data files are used for Tracktable's internal
tests and provide a good representation of the type of data that can be processed by Tracktable.

.. todo:: When the "super-duper example data file" is created update this section with it's location.

External to Tracktable
======================

Below are data resources that can provide data for Tracktable to process. This is by
no means a comprehensive list of resources but rather a springboard for real world data
compatiable with Tracktable.

.. tip:: The Tracktable library is designed to process large datasets,
   so the larger the dataset used the better results Tracktable will produce.
