## What's In This Directory

This is TRACKTABLE_ROOT/tracktable.  This directory holds all of the
source code and header files.

All of the Python source code is in the Python/ subdirectory.  The
other directories here (Analysis, Core, IO, PythonWrapping) hold C++
code.

The Examples subdirectory holds self-contained examples of how to use
various features of the Tracktable C++ interface.  They will be built
if the `BUILD_EXAMPLES` option is turned on in CMake (which it is
by default).
